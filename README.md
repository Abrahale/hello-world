# hello-world
this is To learn how to use Git hub, even though I opened this account a while ago, I didn't get time to do anything here.
I am a student at the University of Natal, Doing my second year in computer Science and 3rd in IT.  I love to code.
I can code in JAVA,C#,PHP,Python,VB,JavaScript,SQL,MySql etc and I also know HTML5,CSS3,JQuery,AJAX this are the languages I can actually think of right now, but the first 3 are my favourites, I also like building websites and web servers.
